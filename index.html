        <h2>Chapter 5: Artificial Intelligence in Games</h2>
        <p>Game Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to make non-player characters (NPCs) act in ways that seem smart and make the game more fun. Instead of trying to copy real-life intelligence, game AI focuses on creating enjoyable challenges and realistic actions to keep players engaged. It involves three main parts: decision making (choosing what to do), movement (navigating the game world), and strategy (planning actions in groups). Game AI follows a process where characters sense their surroundings, think about the best response, and then act. Developers often design AI with small flaws on purpose to keep the game fair and entertaining. Behind the scenes, simple algorithms and data structures help the AI run smoothly, especially on devices with limited processing power.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6: Game Production</h2>
        <p>Game production is the step-by-step process of developing a video game, involving creative ideas, technical work, and business planning. It includes stages like concept, pre-production, production, post-production, and maintenance phase. A producer leads the project by managing time, money, and communication among the team. Developers, designers, artists, and testers work together to build the game, while marketers promote it to the public. Testing helps fix bugs and improve gameplay. After the game is released, updates or new content may be added. In the end, game production is all about teamwork, organization, and creativity to deliver a successful game.</p>
